I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, advised by [Prof. Wenbing Tao](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/taowenbing/zh_CN/index/1485744/list/index.htm). Before that, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree from Central South University in 2016. I was a visiting Ph.D. student in the Computer Vision and Geometry Group at ETH Zurich, advised by [Prof. Marc Pollefeys](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/pomarc/) from October 2020 to May 2021. My research interests lie in the field of 3D computer vision, including multi-view stereo and deep learning with geometry.
